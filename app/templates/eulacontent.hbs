signals. You also understand that Company does not receive signals when the

transmission mode is or becomes non-operational and that signals from the Product

cannot be received by Company when the Product is damaged, does not have an

adequate power source or is otherwise non-operational. Accordingly, you agree that

Company shall not, in any way, be liable for, or have responsibility with respect to,

the cellular telephone network, any of the information obtained therefrom, or for

interruptions in service for any reason whatsoever. You further acknowledge and

agree that Company shall not have any liability for the interruption of services due

to electrical storms, power failures, interruption or unavailability of telephone

liability and obligations of Company to you under this Agreement for Services are

or altered after installation of the Product as to render continuation of any Service impractical; or

negligence, failure to perform duties under this agreement, strict liability, failure to comply with

any applicable law, or other fault. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

16. MEDIATION/ARBITRATION –

a. In the event of any dispute under this Agreement, the parties hereto desire to avoid

litigation. Accordingly, the aggrieved party will give notice of the dispute to the other

party and both parties will attempt to settle the dispute during the thirty (30) day period

following such notice. If such dispute remains unsettled, the parties agree to then submit

such dispute to mediation. If the parties cannot agree on a mediator, each will select a

mediator and the two chosen mediators will select a third mediator who shall alone hear

the dispute. Such mediation will, if possible, be conducted during the sixty (60) day

16

period following expiration of the thirty (30) day period. If such mediation fails to

resolve the dispute, the parties agree such dispute will be submitted to final and binding

arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Unless

otherwise directed by the arbitrator, such arbitration must be concluded within ninety

(90) days of the expiration of the sixty (60) day period previously specified for

mediation. If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, each will select an arbitrator,

and the two chosen arbitrators will select a third arbitrator who shall alone decide the

dispute. Any mediation or arbitration conducted hereunder will be conducted in Orange

County, California. The parties hereto shall equally share the costs of mediation

(including the mediator’s fees and expenses and costs directly related to the conduct of

the mediation, but excluding each party’s direct costs for transportation, attorneys, etc.,

for which each will be responsible). If any party fails to participate in mediation or

arbitration after receipt of notice thereof, then each party hereto agrees that the other

party shall have the right to proceed immediately to arbitration and that such other party

shall be entitled to select the arbitrator in its sole discretion. Each party further agrees

that, in such event, such arbitrator shall have the right to decide the dispute as if the non-
participating party were participating in the arbitration and that such decision shall be

final and binding upon each party hereto.

b. Attorney Fees and Other Arbitration Expenses. If any party hereto resorts to arbitration to

remedy a breach of this Agreement, the prevailing party in the arbitration, in addition to

any other remedies available under this Agreement or by law, may collect all or a portion

of its reasonable attorney fees and other costs and expenses of arbitration at the discretion

of the arbitrator, who shall consider both the reasonableness of the attorney fees and other

costs and the relative merits of each party’s position. It is the intent of all parties hereto to

avoid arbitration without preventing a party from seeking redress for a valid dispute. To

that end, all parties express their intent and agreement that unreasonable attorney fees and

costs not be awarded, and that all or a portion of reasonable attorney fees and costs be

awarded when in the arbitrator’s opinion the party against whom such fees and costs are

awarded has maintained position(s) which have significantly less merit compared to the

prevailing party’s position(s). Further, it is all parties’ intent that any party seeking redress

through litigation despite the fact that arbitration is required by this Agreement, shall not

be entitled to recover any attorney fees or costs for such litigation or in any subsequent

arbitration, regardless of the outcome of such litigation or subsequent arbitration.

17. VENUE - It is the express intent of the parties that any dispute under this Agreement be decided

in accordance with the mediation and arbitration provisions contained in Section 16 hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a court refuses to enforce the provisions contained in

Section 17 for any dispute or, in the event a court is asked to decide a dispute concerning the

provisions contained in Section 16, the parties expressly agree that jurisdiction and venue for any

actions under or pursuant to this Agreement shall be solely in any state court in Orange County,

California, or the Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, sitting in Santa

Ana, California.

17

18. MISCELLANEOUS - The terms and conditions hereof shall be governed by and construed in

accordance with the laws of the State of California without resort to its conflicts of laws. The

invalidity, in whole or in part, of any term or condition hereof shall not affect the validity of the

remainder hereof. The failure of either Company or you to enforce at any time any of the terms

and conditions hereof shall not constitute or be construed to be a waiver of such terms and

conditions or of the right of such party thereafter to enforce any such terms and conditions. You

are solely responsible for complying with any orders, rules, and regulations of the Federal

Communication Commission, or any other federal, state or local governmental authority,

applicable to the purchase, installation, and operation of Product. Except as expressly provided

herein, the terms and conditions hereof are for the benefit of Company and you and no other party.

This Agreement constitutes the final and entire agreement between you and Company and

supersedes any prior agreements, written or oral. There are no other agreements written or oral.

Company has made no representation, warranty, or covenant not contained in this Agreement.

Further, no amendment, modification, or waiver of, or supplement to, this Agreement shall be

effective, unless it is in writing. Company may send you written notification of any modification,

amendment or supplement to this Agreement and you will have sixty (60) days from the date of

such written notification to object in writing to such modification, amendment or supplement, in

which case Company will have the right to either terminate this Agreement or allow this

Agreement to continue without the proposed modification, amendment or supplement. Failure to

object to any modification, amendment or supplement in writing will constitute your acceptance

of such modification, amendment or supplement. The agreements made herein may not be

modified, supplemented, or changed in whole or in part by any waiver (other than a written

waiver signed by the party to be charged), oral representation, or course of dealing. The terms and

conditions of this Agreement shall govern notwithstanding any inconsistent or additional terms

and conditions of any other document submitted by you.
